- Lacks uniqueness; similar outputs for different users

## Example Project
- Java Music Player App (Jan-May 2023)
- Features:
  - Desktop music application using Java
  - GUI with Swing
  - JSON data persistence
  - JUnit test suite

## AI-Generated Cover Letter Analysis

# "Do Not..." Resume Writing Tips

![Red X symbol](image_url)

## Avoid These Practices:

- Copy what is exactly on your resume

- Include negative information
- Overuse phrases like:
  - "I think"
  - "I believe"
  - "I had to"
- Start each sentence with "I"
- Rely fully on AI to write your document

# Editing

- Spell checker limitations (underlined = correct):
  - **JSON** vs JASON
  - jUnit vs Junit vs **JUnit** (teach spell checker NOT to auto-correct)
  - Typescript vs **TypeScript**
  - Javascript vs **JavaScript**
  - **MATLAB** vs Mathlab
  - **Perl** vs Pearl
  - **Quite** vs quit/quiet
  - **Fourth** vs Forth Year
  - University of British **Columbia** vs Colombia

- **Always triple check or have someone else check it for you!**

> Note: Spell checkers don't catch all errors, especially with technical terms and proper nouns. Manual review is crucial.
