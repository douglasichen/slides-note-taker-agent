The compiler assigns the address when it compiles the program\nB. The compiler calls the memory to allocate `a` when it compiles the program\nC. The compiler generates code to allocate `a` before the program starts running\nD. The program locates available space for `a` before it starts running\nE. The program locates available space as soon as the variable is used for the first time\n\n## Key Points\n- Global variables in C are allocated at compile time\n- Their addresses are determined before the program starts running\n- Option A is the correct answer\n\n## Note\nThis question tests understanding of memory allocation for global variables in C programming."
