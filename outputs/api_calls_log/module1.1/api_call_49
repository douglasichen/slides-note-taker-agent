    "notes": "# Ex. 6b: From Level 2 to Level 3 Accomplishment Statements\n\n## A* Pathfinding Algorithm\n- **Original:** Constructed a maze using a 2D array filled with object instances which allowed for modularity and efficiency\n- **Revised:** Iteratively added neighbouring nodes to the worklist in the order of most to least optimal, which decreases computation by prioritizing exploring nodes that make progress towards target and avoiding backtracking\n\n## Discord Bot\n- **Original:** Fixed bugs in MySQL databases\n- **Revised:** Fixed bugs that caused deadlocks in MySQL databases by using asynchronous functions\n\n---\n**Key Improvements:**\n1. More specific technical details\n2. Clearer explanation of problem-solving approach\n3. Emphasis on efficiency and optimization\n4. Demonstration of advanced programming concepts (e.g., asynchronous functions)"
