    "notes": "# FAQs\n\n## How do I identify my part in a group project?\n- Start bullet with \"Contributions:\" or \"Specific responsibilities:\"\n\n## Should I list my scholarship amount?\n- Explain award reason, not dollar amount\n- Example: **Greer Family Scholarship** -- awarded for academic achievement and community involvement in Computer Science Department\n\n## Should I include my high school info?\n- Less valuable at UBC level\n- Include exceptional achievements under Awards/Extra-curricular\n- Omit generic high school accolades (e.g., \"Top grade 12 Math student\")\n- Focus on accumulating university achievements/involvement\n\n> Encouragement: Start building your university portfolio!"
