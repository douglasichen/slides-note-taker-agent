Not enough information to tell\n\n## Analysis\n1. `a[0]`: 1st memory load\n2. `b[0]`: 2nd memory load\n3. `a[b[0]]`: 3rd memory load (using result of 2nd load)\n4. `b[a[0]]`: Final write operation (not a load)\n\n**Correct answer: C. 4**\n\n- 3 memory loads are required\n- 1 memory store (write) operation is performed\n- Total of 4 memory operations, but question asks specifically about loads"
